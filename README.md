In this project, I designed an online Bookstore Website. I used HTML/CSS/JavaScript/JQuery/Ajax in the front-end, PHP for server-side scripting, and MySQL for database. 

A user can log-in or register for a new account at log-in page. Validation is checking for the existing email address and user name when user registers. 

There are two types of user: admin and normal user. If normal user logged in, all the admin functions will not be shown. A normal user can search/check-in/check-out a book as well as paying the fine. An admin user can do all the normal user can do plus the privilege to add/update/delete a book. When a book is on loan, admin cannot delete this book.
